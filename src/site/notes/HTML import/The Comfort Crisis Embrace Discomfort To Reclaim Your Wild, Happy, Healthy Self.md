We see gray. And the shade of gray we see depends on all of the other shades that came before it. We adjust expectations.

“prevalence-induced concept change.”

26

When a new comfort is introduced, we adapt to it and our old comforts become unacceptable.

Today’s comfort is tomorrow’s discomfort.

The process is the reward. But a successful outcome makes the process that much more rewarding.

the moment where the life cycle ends for one living thing so that it may continue for another.

“I believe people have innate evolutionary machinery that gets triggered when they go out and do really fucking hard things. When they explore those edges of their comfort zone.”

Lapsing into flow requires two conditions: The task must stretch a person’s limits and it must have a clear goal.

“the hero’s journey.” The hero exits the comfort of home for adventure.

50

three key elements.

50

The first is separation. The person exits the society in which they live and ventures into the wild.

50

The second is transition. The person enters a challenging middle ground, where they battle with nature and their mind telling them to quit.

The third is incorporation. The person completes the challenge and reenters their normal life an improved person.

magic in 20 minutes.

126

20 minutes outside, three times a week, is the dose of nature that most efficiently dropped people’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

everyone measures their food somehow. How else would you determine a portion? But they just do it subconsciously, without precision.

163

two kinds of stress: acute and chronic.

163

Acute stress is an alarm response, like a “jump scare” in a horror movie.

163

Chronic stress is less intense but long-lasting.

163

Humans and other primates are uniquely predisposed to chronic stress.

164

The slow drip of cortisol from chronic stress not only kickstarts reward eating in many people but also erodes their self-restraint. This creates “a potent formula for obesity,” wrote Potenza.

“The reason I belabor this concept with my clients is because of those mechanoreceptors in our stomachs that communicate with our brains to signal fullness,” Kashey said. “Pretend that in a perfect world it takes one pound of food for these mechanoreceptors to be happy. You can see how a person could leverage this to be full on fewer calories.”

180

“If you eat…before bed, you’re not going to have any autophagy. That means you’re not going to take out the trash, so the cells begin to accumulate more and more debris.”

181

paradoxically, a lack of food typically leads to a surge of energy. “The ability to function at a high level, both physically and mentally, during our extended periods without food may have been of fundamental importance in our evolutionary history,”

181

people who stop eating a few hours before bed sleep better, said Panda.

“If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life—and only then will I be free to become myself.”

“Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.”

204

minimalism looks good on Instagram.

“Death by violence, death by cold, death by starvation—these are the normal endings of the stately and beautiful creatures of the wilderness.
