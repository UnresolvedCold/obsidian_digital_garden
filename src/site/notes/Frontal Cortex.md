It becomes fully online when people cross their mid twenties. 

Most of the human brain is not any different from other species.
We just have larger number of neurons compared to other species. 
But frontal cortex is actually different kind of cells. 
One such cell is [[von Economo neurons\|spindle neurons]] which is common b/w complex species like elephants and dolphin and human. This is an exception compared to other kinds of neurons present in the frontal cortex.

[[von Economo neurons\|spindle neurons]] occur in [[insular cortex\|insular cortex]] and [[anterior cingulate\|anterior cingulate]].

Frontal cortex is bidirectionally linked with [[limbic system\|limbic system]].
They stimulate and inhibit each other and drives decision making. 

And with all these, comes the high metabolic rate. 
## Functions
The frontal cortex is concerned with **focusing on the task**. 
It also meditates executive functions, looking for **patterns and strategic thinking**. 
It **tracks rules**. Don't pee whenever you like it. 

## Parts of frontal cortex

### [[Prefrontal cortex\|Prefrontal cortex]]
Once a decision is made at prefrontal cortex, the signal is sent to [[premotor cortex\|premotor cortex]].

## Energy used by frontal cortex
It has a very high metabolic rate. 
And hence it cannot function all the time and needs rest.
Self control is regulated by frontal cortex and when it gets tired, your self control shatters. 
Self control is finite. 
If your frontal cortex has worked very hard before, you will witness decreased productivity in other tasks as well.
Good thing is if you develop a habit, which means you transfer the activity to a more permanent structure like [[cerebellum\|cerebellum]] then you can automatically perform the action without involving the cortex too much. Like potty-training. Once you are trained, your life becomes easier.
