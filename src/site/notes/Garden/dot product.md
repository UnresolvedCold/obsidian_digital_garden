# Dot product of 2 vectors

Dot product of 2 vectors $v1$ and $v2$ is defined as $|v1| |v2| cos(\theta)$.
Or if the vectors are written as components $v1 = (v1_x, v1_y, v1_z, ...)$, $v2=(v2_x, v2_y, v2_z,...)$ then the dot product is just the sum of product of all the components, $v1_x v2_x + v1_y v2_y + v1_z v2_z + ...$
