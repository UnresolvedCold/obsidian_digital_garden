These are not literal separation. But functionally you can divide the brain into 3 layers. 
The flow of command is bidirectional b/w layers. 
#### Layer 1
Automatic functions.
Body temperature drops then send shiver signal. 
#### Layer 2
About emotions. 
It's found in mammals. 
If you saw something gruesome, it sends signal to layer 1. 
#### Layer 3
Cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions and philosophies. 
If you read something gruesome, layer 3 sends signal to layer 2 which sends signal to layer 1 and makes you shiver.
