# One second before 
 This is about what neural activities of chemical activities happen just before a behaviour happens.
 It starts with the exploration of different parts of the brain add how they are connected.
 In [[primates\|primates]] , the [[limbic system\|limbic system]] is highly active towards olfactory stumli. In human, the [[limbic system\|limbic system]] is highly active with visual cues. [[limbic system\|limbic system]] is the center of emotions. [[limbic system\|limbic system]] influences what [[hypothalmus\|hypothalmus]] does. 

### 3 layers of brain

These are not literal separation. But functionally you can divide the brain into 3 layers. 
The flow of command is bidirectional b/w layers. 
#### Layer 1
Automatic functions.
Body temperature drops then send shiver signal. 
#### Layer 2
About emotions. 
It's found in mammals. 
If you saw something gruesome, it sends signal to layer 1. 
#### Layer 3
Cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions and philosophies. 
If you read something gruesome, layer 3 sends signal to layer 2 which sends signal to layer 1 and makes you shiver.  

### Autonomic Nervous System
[[Sympathetic Nervous System\|Sympathetic Nervous System]] and [[Parasympathetic Nervous System\|Parasympathetic Nervous System]] 

### Interface b/w [[limbic system\|limbic system]] and [[Cortex\|Cortex]]
