## Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Shubham

Welcome to my **digital garden** - a curated space where I document and refine my thinking, one note at a time.

This isnâ€™t a traditional blog. Itâ€™s more like a working knowledge base: a hybrid of fleeting thoughts, ongoing experiments, personal learnings, and technical deep dives. Some of the content here may be rough around the edges, intentionally so. Just like a real garden, this space is designed to evolve over time, with notes growing, merging, or being pruned as I revisit and expand my understanding.

### ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- **Work-in-progress notes** on software engineering, architecture, systems thinking, and tooling.
- **Technical explorations**, from distributed systems and backend design to dev tooling and productivity workflows.
- **Learning notes** from books, research papers, and talks, distilled and contextualized for future reference.
- **Meta reflections** on problem-solving, developer workflows, and the craft of writing maintainable code.
- Occasional **code snippets, experiments**, and references to open-source contributions or side projects Iâ€™m tinkering with.

I write with the mindset that **"thinking in public"** is the best way to sharpen ideas. Some of these thoughts may eventually be polished into long-form essays or tutorials over at [shubham.codes](https://shubham.codes/), but many will remain here in their raw, iterative form - and thatâ€™s by design.

### ðŸ§­ Why a Digital Garden?

In fast-moving domains like software engineering, knowledge decays quickly. Blogs are great for publishing finished work, but they often hide the messy process that leads to clarity. This garden reflects **how I learn** â€” incrementally, with feedback loops, interlinked ideas, and deliberate revisits.

If you're someone who values continuous learning, tool-assisted thinking, and building mental models from the ground up, then you might find something of value here.

### ðŸš§ Work in Progress

Not everything here is meant to be definitive. Some posts might just be questions Iâ€™m still working through. Others might challenge common assumptions or explore unconventional perspectives. Corrections, insights, and conversations are always welcome.
