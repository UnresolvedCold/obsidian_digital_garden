# Seconds to Minutes Before

No brain is an island.

ethology, the science of interviewing an animal in its own language.

## UNIVERSAL RULES VERSUS KNOBBY KNEES
stimulus and response: rewarding an organism for a behavior makes the organism more likely to repeat that behavior, while failure to get rewarded or, worse, punishment for it, makes the organism less likely to repeat it.

operant conditioning - controlling the rewards and punishments in the organism’s environment.

Basically, [[ethology\|ethology]] is all about finding the true behaviour of a species in its natural habitat.
You cannot judge the behaviour of dolphin in a bathtub. 

## Sensory Triggers of Behavior in Some Other Species

Animals vocalize to intimidate, proclaim, and seduce.

There are also visual triggers of behavior. Dogs crouch to invite play, birds strut their plumage, monkeys display their canines menacingly with “threat yawns.”

there are visual cues of cute baby–ness (big eyes, shortened muzzle, round forehead) that drive mammals crazy, motivating them to care for the kid

Basically, there are visual, vocal and many other ways in which these species communicate. And these communication mechanism includes ways which are beyond human sensory interpretation. 
## Under the Radar: Subliminal and Unconscious Cuing

Your brain reacts to color of skin in one-tenth of the second. 

depending on the race of the face (as shown with neuroimaging). First, in a widely replicated finding, the amygdala activates

The more resist a person is the more is the activation in amygdala. 

"fear conditioning” occurs faster for other-race than same-race faces. This is basically showing a face and giving a shock. For same race, the activation of [[Garden/amygdala\|amygdala]] is less as compared to cross race pictures. 

people judge neutral other-race faces as angrier than neutral same-race faces.

But if the face is shown long enough for conscious processing, the [[Garden/anterior cingulate\|anterior cingulate]] and the “cognitive” [[Garden/dlPFC\|dlPFC]] then activate and inhibit the amygdala

It’s the [[Garden/Frontal Cortex\|Frontal Cortex]] exerting executive control over the deeper, darker amygdaloid response.

subliminal signaling of race also affects the [[fusiform face area\|fusiform face area]]. You are dependent on race input to recognize faces. 

white Americans remember white better than black faces

mixed-race faces are remembered better if described as being of a white rather than a black person.

Show a video of someone’s hand being poked with a needle, and subjects have an “isomorphic sensorimotor” response—hands tense in empathy. Among both whites and blacks, the response is blunted for other-race hands;

Threatening faces produce a distinctive change (called the [[P200 component\|P200 component]]) in the ERP waveform in under **two hundred milliseconds**

Among white subjects, viewing someone black evokes a **stronger P200 waveform** than viewing someone white, regardless of whether the person is armed.

Then, a few milliseconds later, a second, inhibitory waveform (the N200 component) appears, originating from the frontal cortex—“Let’s think a sec about what we’re seeing before we shoot.”

> Basically, first the brain flags the person as threat and after some amount of time [[Garden/Frontal Cortex\|Frontal Cortex]] sends the signal saying it is not a threat. 
> For a person of different race, the intensity of threat is very high and the intensity of not a threat signal is low.

P200/N200 ratio (i.e., the greater the ratio of I’m-feeling-threatened to Hold-on-a-sec), the greater the likelihood of shooting an unarmed black individual

If a music belonging to black people is heard by white people, it triggers [[Garden/amygdala\|amygdala]] fear response

If you are around people who smell feared, your brain assumes you are feared too. This was evident from [[armpit sweat experiment\|armpit sweat experiment]]. This is because human brain can recognize fear from the [[pheremones\|pheremones]] present in the sweat. 

## Interoceptive Information

you subliminally note the lion, speeding up your heart; then your conscious brain gets this interoceptive information, concluding, “Wow, my heart is racing; I must be terrified.”

Forcing depressed people to smile makes them feel better. If you are smiling then it means something good has happened. 

Changing your posture to confident posture reduced anxiety. 

processing social emotions—the PFC, insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala—receive lots of interoceptive information

Pain activates most of these regions. Pain amplifies aggression. 

## Unconscious Language Effects

Words have power. They can save, cure, uplift, devastate, deflate, and kill

One person's freedom fighter is another's terrorist 

Doctor recommends meds labeled 95% survival chance and not those with 5% death chance 
## Even Subtler Types of Unconscious Cuing

emergency requiring brave intervention, the more people present, the less likely anyone is to help—“There’s lots of people here; someone else will step forward.”

the presence of women makes men more prosocial

## A Wonderfully Complicating Piece of the Story

the brain can alter the sensitivity of those sensory modalities, making some stimuli more influential

[[Urbach-Wiethe disease\|Urbach-Wiethe disease]], which selectively destroys the amygdala. It was seen that the absence of amygdala, reduces the number of times you look at the eye of someone. And eyes are the cues that help human understand anger. These patients fails to recognise anger. But if asked to focus on eyes, their anger identifying improves. This indicates amygdala, tells us where to look for information as well. 

not only does the amygdala detect fearful faces, but it also biases us toward obtaining information about fearful faces.

culture literally shapes how and where you look at the world

# Hours to Days Before

## TESTOSTERONE’S BUM RAP

high levels of testosterone receptors in the [[Garden/amygdala\|amygdala]]

even when [[testosterone\|testosterone]] and [[androgens\|androgens]] are completely eliminated, some aggression remains. Thus, some male aggression is testosterone independent.

the more experience a male had being aggressive prior to castration, the more aggression continues afterward.

Aggression is learned from society. Testosterone add to the aggression but is not responsible to generate aggression.  

## Subtleties of Testosterone Effects

When looking at faces expressing strong emotions, we tend to make microexpressions that mimic them; testosterone decreases such empathic mimicry

Testosterone makes strangers less trustworthy. It activates the [[Garden/amygdala\|amygdala]] more for strangers. 

After winning a fight, testosterone is secreted.
Testosterone increases glucose delivery and metabolism. And this makes pheremones smell scarier. 

Winning also increases testosterone receptors in [[Garden/bed nucleus of the stria terminalis\|bed nucleus of the stria terminalis]]. It becomes more sensitive to the hormone. 

Testosterone decreases the[[Garden/Prefrontal cortex\|Prefrontal cortex]] activity. 

testosterone’s effects are hugely context dependent.

## Contingent Testosterone Effects

rather than causing X, testosterone amplifies the power of something else to cause X.

Testosterone did not create new social patterns of aggression; it exaggerated preexisting ones.

testosterone didn’t raise baseline activity in the amygdala; it boosted the amygdala’s response and heart-rate reactivity to angry faces (but not to happy or neutral ones)

## A Key Synthesis: The Challenge Hypothesis

it prompts whatever behaviors are needed to maintain status. This changes things enormously.

subjects were given testosterone beforehand? People made more generous offers in situations which required generosity 

## OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN: A MARKETING DREAM

Oxytocin prepares the body of a female mammal for birth and lactation

oxytocin also facilitates maternal behavior

lots of grooming and physical contact predicted high oxytocin levels in female members of a pair. What predicted high levels of oxytocin in males? Lots of sex.

circulating oxytocin levels are elevated in couples when they’ve first hooked up

the higher the levels, the more physical affection, the more behaviors are synchronized, the more long-lasting the relationship

oxytocin and vasopressin facilitate bonding between parent and child and between couples.

This evolved in such a way that human can tame dogs and oxytocin is secreted by dog.
Increases oxytocin makes a dog stare at its owner longer. And in human gazing increases oxytocin and this creates a parent child relation within different species 

oxytocin inoculated betrayal aversion among investors

oxytocin is released when we experience prosocial behavior

## Prosociality Versus Sociality

Oxytocin increases the accuracy of assessments of other people’s thoughts, with a gender twist—women improve at detecting kinship relations, while men improve at detecting dominance relations

Oxytocin increases accuracy in detecting faces

When playing against strangers, oxytocin decreases cooperation, enhances envy when luck is bad, and enhances gloating when it’s good.

oxytocin makes you more prosocial to people like you but spontaneously lousy to others

## THE ENDOCRINOLOGY OF AGGRESSION IN FEMALES

During late pregnancy, estrogen and progesterone increase maternal aggression by increasing oxytocin release in certain brain regions

Estrogen contributes to maternal aggression. But estrogen can also reduce aggression and enhance empathy and emotional recognition. There are different receptors for estrogen in brain.

progesterone, working with estrogen, promotes maternal aggression. However, on its own it decreases aggression and anxiety

## STRESS AND IMPRUDENT BRAIN FUNCTION

### The Basic Dichotomy of the Acute and the Chronic Stress Response

Glucocorticoids plus the sympathetic nervous system enable an organism to survive a physical stressor by activating the classical “fight or flight” response. Whether you are that zebra or that lion, you’ll need energy for your muscles, and the stress response rapidly mobilizes energy into circulation from storage sites in your body. Furthermore, heart rate and blood pressure increase, delivering that circulating energy to exercising muscles faster. Moreover, during stress, long-term building projects—growth, tissue repair, and reproduction—are postponed until after the crisis; after all, if a lion is chasing you, you have better things to do with your energy than, say, thicken your uterine walls

Stress involves physical stress and the thinking that your homeostatis will become imbalanced 

### Sustained Stress and the Neurobiology of Fear

stress or glucocorticoid administration decreases accuracy when rapidly assessing emotions of faces

stress makes it easier to learn a fear association and to consolidate it into a long-term memory.

stress weakens the PFC’s hold over the amygdala

Stress also makes it harder to unlearn fear

### Sustained Stress, Executive Function, and Judgment

in one study, prolonged administration of high glucocorticoid levels to healthy subjects impaired working memory into the range seen after frontal cortical damage
Glucocorticoids accomplish this by enhancing norepinephrine signaling in the PFC so much that, instead of causing aroused focus, it induces chicken-with-its-head-cut-off cognitive tumult, and by enhancing disruptive signaling from the amygdala to the PFC

Stress impairs the ability to switch between tasks
stress weakens frontal connections with the hippocampus, shifting to me strategies becomes hard

major stressors make people of both genders more risk taking

moderate stressors bias men toward, and women away from, risk taking

Stated most broadly, sustained stress impairs risk assessment

### Sustained Stress and Pro- and Antisociality

There’s an additional depressing reason why stress fosters aggression—because it reduces stress.

guess that lashing out activates dopaminergic reward pathways, a surefire way to inhibit CRH release.*

stress biases us toward selfishness.

Does stress decrease empathy? Seemingly yes

a mouse’s pain threshold is lowered when it is near another mouse in pain, but only if the other mouse is its cagemate

The presence of a strange mouse triggers a stress response. But when glucocorticoid secretion is temporarily blocked, mice show the same “pain empathy” for a strange mouse as for a cagemate

glucocorticoid creates a huge difference between us and them

“male = fight/flight and female = tend/befriend.”

## SOME IMPORTANT DEBUNKING: ALCOHOL

alcohol only evokes aggression only in (a) individuals prone to aggression

b) those who believe that alcohol makes you more aggressive, once more showing the power of social learning to shape biology

# Days to Months Before

## NONLINEAR EXCITATION

a new memory requires the formation of a new synapse

Forming memories doesn’t require new synapses (let alone new branches or neurons); it requires the strengthening of preexisting synapses.

repeated firing across a synapse “strengthens” it, with a key role played by the neurotransmitter glutamate.

LTP—“long-term potentiation.”

NMDA receptors finally activate and open their channels, it is calcium, rather than sodium, that flows in.

calcium tidal wave causes more copies of glutamate receptors

calcium also alters glutamate receptors that are already on the front lines of that dendritic spine; each will now be more sensitive to glutamate signals

causes the synthesis of peculiar neurotransmitters in the dendritic spine, which are released

presynaptic axon terminal yelling “glutamate” more loudly and the postsynaptic dendritic spine listening more attentively

LTD—long-term “depression

LTD is not the functional opposite of LTP either—rather than being the basis of generic forgetting, it sharpens a signal by erasing what’s extraneous.

one mechanism underlying LTP is an alteration in glutamate receptors so that they are more responsive to glutamate

All this is cool, but LTP and LDP are what happens in the hippocampus when you learn explicit facts, like someone’s phone number

### Rescued from the Trash

Whether the amygdala is also activated seems to determine whether the hippocampus interprets the glucocorticoids as good or bad stress

### Axonal Plasticity

## DIGGING DEEPER IN THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY

Brain changes and hence people change

## Adolescence; or, Dude, Where’s My Frontal Cortex?

it’s the time of life of maximal risk taking, novelty seeking, and affiliation with peers. All because of that immature frontal cortex.

## THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF FRONTAL CORTICAL MATURATION

The delayed maturation of the frontal cortex suggests an obvious scenario, namely that early in adolescence the frontal cortex has fewer neurons, dendritic branches, and synapses than in adulthood, and that levels increase into the midtwenties. Instead, levels decrease.

frontal cortical maturation during adolescence is about a more efficient brain, not more brain

### Frontal Cortical Changes in Cognition in Adolescence

### Frontal Cortical Changes in Emotional Regulation

In adolescence, though, the vmPFC response is less; thus the amygdaloid response keeps growing.

Reappraisal strategies get better during adolescence, with logical neurobiological underpinnings

## ADOLESCENT RISK TAKING

during risky decision making, adolescents activate the prefrontal cortex less than do adults;the less activity, the poorer the risk assessment.

During adolescence, dopamine projection density and signaling steadily increase in both pathways (although novelty seeking itself peaks at midadolescence, probably reflecting the emerging frontal regulation after that).

In adults, small, medium, and large rewards caused small, medium, and large increases in accumbens activity

## PEERS, SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE, AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION

Adolescent vulnerability to peer pressure from friends, especially peers they want to accept them as friends, is storied

adolescents are more social and more complexly social than children or adults

kids who are more sensitive to peer pressure are more prepared to imitate someone else’s emotionality

harm to people increasingly activates the amygdala, while the opposite occurs for harm to objects

By preadolescence, egalitarianism gives way to acceptance of inequality because of merit or effort or for a greater good

By adolescence, boys tend to accept inequality more than girls do

### Moral Development

three stages of moral

kids reconcile more readily when the relationship matters to them.

### Preconventional Reasoning

#### Stage 1
Should I eat the cookie? 
How likely am I to get punished? Being punished is unpleasant

Aggression typically peaks around ages two through four, after which kids are reined in by adults’ punishment
#### Stage 2
It depends. If I refrain, will I get rewarded?

kids reconcile more readily when the relationship matters to them.

### Conventional Reasoning

#### Stage 3

What will people think of me for eating the cookie?
#### Stage 4

What’s the law? Are laws sacrosanct? What if everyone broke this law?

### Postconventional Reasoning

#### Stage 5
What circumstances placed the cookie there? Who decided that I shouldn’t take it?
#### Stage 6

Is my moral stance regarding this more vital than some law, a stance for which I’d pay the ultimate price if need be?

## THE IMPORTANCE OF MOTHERS

What do children need from their mothers?”: love, warmth, affection, responsiveness, stimulation, consistency, reliability

What is produced in their absence? Anxious, depressed, and/or poorly attached adults

when abortions become readily available in an area, rates of crime by young adults decline about twenty years later

## ANY KIND OF MOTHER IN A STORM
Why do we often become attached to a source of negative reinforcement?

Because of poor self-esteem, believing you’ll never do better

“stress hyporesponsive period” (SHRP)

Glucocorticoids have so many adverse effects on brain development

SHRP represents a gamble

attachment to the caretaker has evolved to ensure that the infant forms a bond to that caregiver regardless of the quality of care received.” Any kind of mother in a storm.

## DIFFERENT ROUTES TO THE SAME PLACE

By age five, the lower a child’s socioeconomic status, on the average, the (a) higher the basal glucocorticoid levels and/or the more reactive the glucocorticoid stress response, (b) the thinner the frontal cortex and the lower its metabolism, and (c) the poorer the frontal function concerning working memory, emotion regulation, impulse control, and executive decision making;

low-ranking mother predicts elevated glucocorticoids in adulthood in baboons

## TWO SIDE TOPICS
Exposing children to a violent TV or film clip increases their odds of aggression soon after.41 Interestingly, the effect is stronger in girls (amid their having lower overall levels of aggression). Effects are stronger when kids are younger or when the violence is more realistic and/or is presented as heroic

effects are strongest on kids already prone toward violence

### Bullying

bullying targets aren’t selected at random. Kids with the metaphorical “kick me” signs on their backs are more likely to have personal or family psychiatric issues and poor social and emotional intelligence

The picture of the bullies is no surprise either, starting with their disproportionately coming from families of single moms or younger parents with poor education and employment prospects.

## Collectivist Versus Individualist Cultures

On average, mothers in individualist cultures, when compared with those in collectivist ones, speak louder, play music louder, have more animated expressions.54 They view themselves as teachers rather than protectors, abhor a bored child, value high-energy affect

Mothers in collectivist cultures, in contrast, spend more time than individualist mothers soothing their child, maintaining contact, and facilitating contact with other adults. They value low arousal affect and sleep with their child to a later age. Games are about cooperation and fitting in; if playing with her child with, say, a toy car, the point is not exploring what a car does (i.e., being automobile), but the process of sharing (“Thank you for giving me your car; now I’ll give it back to you”). Kids are trained to get along, think of others, accept and adapt, rather than change situations

kids in (collectivist) Japan play more violent video games than do American kids, yet are less aggressive

## 9 long months

### The Cat in the Hat in the Womb

What goes in the mother's amniotic fluid shapes the taste preferences. This might include the spices mother ate.

A pregnant woman’s voice is audible in the womb, and newborns recognize and prefer the sound of their mother’s voice

## BOY AND GIRL BRAINS, WHATEVER THAT MIGHT MEAN

testosterone has much of its masculinizing effect in the brain by becoming estrogen.

Testosterone exposure throughout pregnancy produced daughters who were “pseudohermaphrodites”—looked like males on the outside but had female gonads on the

stressed mothers secrete glucocorticoids, which enter fetal circulation and basically have the same bad consequences as in stressed infants and children.

offspring of more “attentive” rat mothers (those that frequently nurse, groom, and lick their pups) become adults with lower glucocorticoid levels, less anxiety, better learning, and delayed brain aging
