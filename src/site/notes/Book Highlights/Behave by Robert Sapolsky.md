Behave - Robert M. Sapolsky (Highlight: 115; Note: 0)

◆ Two: ONE SECOND BEFORE

▪ three functional domains:

▪ Layer 1:

▪ automatic, regulatory functions.

▪ Layer 2:

▪ emotions

▪ mammalian invention

▪ In a rodent, olfactory inputs are what the limbic system most depends on for emotional news of the world.

▪ In contrast, the primate limbic system is more informed by visual inputs.

▪ Limbic function is now recognized as central to the emotions

▪ every limbic structure—to influence what the hypothalamus does.

▪ The hypothalamus, a limbic structure, is the interface between layers 1 and 2, between core regulatory and emotional parts of the brain.

▪ hypothalamus

▪ means by which the limbic system influences autonomic function, how layer 2 talks to layer 1

▪ Have a full bladder with its muscle walls distended, and midbrain/brain-stem circuitry votes for urinating. Be exposed to something sufficiently terrifying, and limbic structures, via the hypothalamus, persuade the midbrain and brain stem to do the same

▪ autonomic nervous system has two parts—the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems,

▪ sympathetic nervous system (SNS)

▪ response to arousing circumstances

▪ fight or flight

▪ SNS mediates the “four Fs—fear, fight, flight, and sex.”

▪ norepinephrine

▪ adrenaline

▪ parasympathetic nervous system (PNS)

▪ PNS is about calm, vegetative states.

▪ acetylcholine

▪ Cortex

▪ sensory information

▪ muscles are commanded to move,

▪ Emotions filter the nature and accuracy of what is remembered.

▪ frontal cortex was bidirectionally enmeshed with the limbic system

▪ frontal cortex and limbic system stimulate or inhibit each other

▪ animal is being aggressive

▪ lesion the amygdala

▪ rates of aggression decline

▪ injecting Novocain

▪ fear and anxiety

▪ fear activates the amygdala in humans, with more activation predicting more behavioral signs of fear

▪ PTSD

▪ amygdala is overreactive

▪ amygdala expands in size with long-term PTSD.

▪ The amygdala is particularly sensitive to unsettling circumstances that are social.

▪ social uncertainty

▪ Being unsure of your place is unsettling

▪ prepared learning

▪ evolutionarily ancient central amygdala plays a key role in innate fears

▪ basolateral amygdala (BLA)

▪ BLA that learns fear and then sends the news to the central amygdala.

▪ When we stop fearing something, it isn’t because some amygdaloid neurons have lost their excitability. We don’t passively forget that something is scary. We actively learn that it isn’t anymore.

▪ the default state is to trust, and what the amygdala does is learn vigilance and distrust

▪ the amount of reward is changing” and “the amount of punishment is changing” are the same

▪ Sensory inputs

▪ amygdala receives news of that reliable trigger of fear and aggression, namely pain

▪ unpredictable pain,

▪ projection from the “insular cortex,

▪ rancid food,

▪ spit it out

▪ disgusting smells

▪ morally disgusting—social norm violations

▪ how much revenge you take

▪ us and them.

▪ hippocampus

▪ amygdala learns fear and the hippocampus learns detached, dispassionate facts

▪ amygdala outputs are mostly about setting off alarms throughout the brain and body

▪ BNST

▪ hormonal stress response

▪ sympathetic nervous system going full blast? During fear, flight, fight, and sex

▪ sex and aggression activate the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn can influence behavior

▪ opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference

▪ Fear typically increases aggression only in those already prone to it

▪ the frontal cortex makes you do the harder thing when it’s the right thing to do.

▪ not fully online until people are in their midtwenties

▪ PFC is essential for categorical thinking

▪ frontal cortex tracks rules

▪ don’t pee whenever you feel like it

▪ working hard, the frontal cortex has an extremely high metabolic rate

▪ self-control is a finite resource

▪ Make the frontal cortex work hard—a tough working-memory task, regulating social behavior, or making numerous decisions while shopping. Immediately afterward performance on a different frontally dependent task declines.

▪ increase cognitive load on the frontal cortex, and afterward subjects become less prosocial*—less charitable or helpful, more likely to lie

▪ soon after we’re potty-trained, doing the harder thing with our bladder muscles becomes automatic.

▪ frontal cortex has to add social factors to a cognitive mix.

▪ Different PFC circuits tracked “reward-driven” and “advice-driven” cogitating

▪ the bigger the size of the average social group, the larger the relative size of the frontal cortex

▪ the bigger the group, the larger the PFC becomes

▪ social complexity expands the frontal cortex.

▪ first “frontal” patient, the famous Phineas Gage,

▪ Gage was described by friends as “no longer Gage,”

▪ the “decider” is being destroyed.*

▪ During REM sleep, when dreaming occurs, the frontal cortex goes off-line,

▪ PFC silences, producing emotional tsunamis: during orgasm.

▪ dorsal part of the PFC, especially the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC)—

▪ decider of deciders

▪ last part to fully mature

▪ ventral part of the PFC,

▪ vmPFC

▪ impact of emotion on decision making

▪ someone forgoes an immediate reward for a bigger one later

▪ transcranial magnetic stimulation can temporarily silence part of someone’s cortex,

▪ subjects playing an economic game impulsively accepted lousy offers that they’d normally reject in the hopes of getting better offers in the future.

▪ effects of vmPFC damage?

▪ differences appear when it comes to making social/emotional decisions—vmPFC patients just can’t decide.*

▪ Damaging the vmPFC, thus removing limbic input to the PFC, eliminates gut feelings, making decisions harder.

▪ Without a vmPFC, you may know the meaning of negative feedback, but you don’t know the feeling of it in your gut and thus don’t shift behavior.

▪ without the dlPFC, the metaphorical superego is gone, resulting in individuals who are now hyperaggressive, hypersexual ids.

▪ without the dlPFC, the metaphorical superego is gone

▪ vmPFC and dlPFC

▪ domination by emotion versus cognition

▪ regulating emotion through thought.

▪ hard to regulate thought

▪ thinking differently” about something emotional differs from simply suppressing the expression of the emotions

▪ frontal cortex; the mantra is that it makes you do the harder thing when that is the right thing

◆ Appendix 1: Neuroscience 101

▪ pain in neuron A’s world is not only transient but also fast. Pain in the neuron D branch not only is long-lasting but also has a slower onset

▪ All the regions of the brain have names

▪ names (usually multisyllabic and derived from Greek or Latin), as do the subregions, and the sub-subregions

▪ Myelin

▪ Thus they’re generically referred to as “white matter.”

▪ Given that every brain region is getting projections from and sending projections to a zillion other places, it is rare that an individual brain region is “the center for” anything. Instead it’s all networks where, far more often, a particular region “plays a key role in,” “helps mediate,” or “influences” a behavior.
