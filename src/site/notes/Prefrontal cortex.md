## Reward Driven vs Advice Driven 
## Parts of PFC - [[dlPFC\|dlPFC]] and [[vmPFC\|vmPFC]]
Damage someones vmPFC and that body can understand the negative choices but fails to decide on the changes. 

> vmPFC vs dlPFC is basically a battle b/w emotions and cognition.

## Train problem 
If you push someone to kill him but save 5 other person. 

Your dlPFC activates as decider and vmPFC activates for emotions. 
The interplay b/w the two results in the decision you will make. 

## antecedent vs response focused
If you saw an amputation video, [[amygdala\|amygdala]] and [[Sympathetic Nervous System\|Sympathetic Nervous System]] awakes. 
If you want to hide the emotional reaction, there are 2 ways antecedent and response focused. 

Response focused is like dragging a horse back to barn after it has fled. 
You basically try to convince yourself that it is okay to watch the video and this causes more activation of [[amygdala\|amygdala]].

Antecedent strategy is better in sense that you divert your focus. You start thinking about something else like a vacation. And this triggers the [[dlPFC\|dlPFC]] and supreses the [[amygdala\|amygdala]] and [[Sympathetic Nervous System\|Sympathetic Nervous System]].
